# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation for creatng this webpage was to provide structure to any notes taken during the prework of a coding bootcamp I am currently enrolled in, so that I can easily find and read the information.
- This project was a learning experience, as it was my first time applying knowledge learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Github.

## Usage

- The webpage is structured into separate sections, each consisting of a different topic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git) that was learned during the bootcamp prework and later applied to create this webpage. Within each section are notes to help the user remember important details learned during the prework. 
- By opening the DevTools console in your browser, the list of the topics learned can be observed and a topic from this list will be chosen and dispayed at random as a suggestion for what to study next.
